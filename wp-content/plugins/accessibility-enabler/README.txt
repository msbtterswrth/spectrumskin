## Benefits We Deliver


### Contributes To Your Sales & Conversion
That’s right. Having an accessible website increase sales. Today, you are losing visitors because your website is not best suited for people with accessibility needs.

Every website has at least 25% of its total traffic coming from people with one or more disabilities. This traffic is significantly large enough – you can’t choose to ignore it. 

 Accessibility Enabler helps to address the need for a differently-abled population to navigate and consume the content. 
 
### Increase Compliance With Accessibility Regulations
Have you heard of UNCRPD, WCAG 2.0, EU 2016/2102, ATAG 2.0, ADA, Section 5o ?. You have guessed it right. All these are various accessibility regulations in different countries. 

Accessibility Enabler helps to make your site more compliant with the accessibility regulations of your country. 
 
### Increase Brand Value & Showcase Social Responsibility
Accessibility creates a positive experience with your brand and turns customers into brand advocates - researchers say.
